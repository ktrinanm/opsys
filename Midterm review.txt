Midterm on Wednesday

Terms:
	-compaction: collecting fragments into a single section of unallocated space by moving the processes in memory
	-external fragmentaton: in dynamic allocation, it's the unusable blocks between other blocks. 	
	-internal fragmentaton: Wasted space at the end of a partition because the allocated process is too small for the fixed-size partition
	-page frames: fixed-length, contiguous block of virtual memory
	-demand paging: A type of swapping in which pages of program data are not copied from disk to RAM until they are needed.
	-page fault: An exception that occurs when the required page is not found in memory and there are no free frames
	-page fault handler: A handler that decides which page to replace with the new page being pulled in
	-page map table: a table that shows, for each job, which page of the job is in which page frame.
	-segment: a group of pages that are known to be needed at the same time.
	-segmentation fault: An exception that occurs when the memory manager detects that there is not room to load a new segment.
	-virtual memory: a memory management technique that involves only loading what is necessary at the moment using pages and segments
	-process control block: a block of memory for each process that contains the process's process status, register contents, contents of all variables, pointers to all open files, and all IO resources in use.
	-context switch: process of storing all items needed to reinstate the process in the Process Control Block, then pulling in the info needed by the next process to restart
	-multiprogramming: a state that allows multiple processes to run.
	-pre-emptive multitasking: a process that uses time quanta to allocate resources to individual processes for that given time quanta.
	-process: an instance of a program in execution
	-process scheduling algorithm: an algorithm used to decided in which order the processes will be scheduled
	-round robin: a simple form of process management that uses a normal queue
	-time quanta: The time given each process to run.
	-deadlock: occurs when the resources for Job A to complete are held by Job B, which in turn is waiting for resources held by Job A before it can finish. Both jobs will be permanently in a hold state.
	-volume: any file storage unit
	-master file directory: stores names and characteristics of every file in the volume
	-pipe: | a character used to redirect the output of the first command to the input of the second
	-redirection: redirecting input or output of a command from or to a text file or string
	-multilevel process queue: Specialized queues used for process management
	-OS kernel: consists of all the data structures and algorithms required to run the OS
	-register: a very fast, temporaray storage that holds information that is being worked on at the moment
	-system bus: a pipeline that connects major components, this can send data, addresses, and commands
	-bus controller: The device that decides to turn on and off access to the bus
	-device controller: a component that handles low level details of requests from the CPU
	-Direct Memory Access: The process of a device controller accessing the RAM and transferring data without any intervention from the CPU
	-device driver: a program responsible for translating the abstractions of the OS into something the device controller can understand
	-block device: a device that transfers data in blocks instead of one at a time
	-character device: a device that sends one character at a time 
	-socket: a device used by network devices and protocols
	-inode number: a 64-bit pointer to the file's inode data structure in the file descriptor table
	-.bashrc: a file used to create settings, functions, and aliases that will be available any time the shell is opened
	-alias: a new name for a command or group of commands
	-environment variable: named values that affect the behavior of running processes
	-interrupt: hardware signal that suspends execution of a program.
	-interrupt handler: a function that runs for a specific device when an interrupt is detected.
	-program counter: a counter that keeps track of the relative address of the next instruction
	
	
Concept questions
	1. Breifly describe what each of the following commands does:
		touch, cp, mv, rm, cat, less
		cd, pwd, ls, mkdir, rmdir,
		ln -s
		clear, echo
		man, help
		history, hostname, whoami, wc, date, cal, which
		|, >, >>, < &, *, $var, #, ~, ./
		df - disk space usage
		ps, kill CNTL-C 
		env, set
		alias - alternate name, export
		source - execute commands from file, ls -al, ls -alR, ls -li, echo $PATH, script, cat /proc/meminfo
		free - displays mem info, PS1='->', head, tail
		dd if=/dev/random of=/tmp/myfile count=1
