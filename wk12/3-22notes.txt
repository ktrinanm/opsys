We will write our own version of cal so it does this:

cal by itself should return the calendar for the entire present year

cal 1980 should give the entire year's calendar

cal Mar 1980 should give the calendar for March 1980

****

$# gives the numbers of arguments

In general, when you type any command, the parameters go into variables $1, $2 ...., $n
