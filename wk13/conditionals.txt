Unix returns a status variable:
0 for OK
1 for not OK

In unix shell:
0 translates to true
1 translates to false

we use the test command (explicitly or implicitly)

[] are alternate syntax for testing

Special parameters:
	$1, $2, etc are the parameters typed after the command
	$# the total number of parameters

We've seen command substitution with this: `command`

We can also do it this way: $(command)
