How hackers like to subvert your system:
	Suppose they can already get to your HOME directory. If they can, they can look
	at your directory system in your home folder and do things like:
		- write a program called ls and put in the bin:
			****
			#!/usr/bin/bash

			/usr/bin/ls

			very bad stuff
			*****
	If they only had access to your home directory, but not the root directory, 
	they can't run the ls from the bin directory under the root. The root one is 
	used first. If it's first, it could use the bin in your bin, not owned by the 
	root.
