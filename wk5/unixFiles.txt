Data files, program files, directories, devices, named pipes, sockets and links are all named files in unix and are treated in a similar way

2 types of links:
	Hard links - can only be used on files. It's a way of giving multiple names
		to the same physical file. If we change the permissions on any of the
		files, it changes on all of them
	Symbolic links - more robust because they accurately reflect the current status.
		Programmers almost always use symbolic links.

The inode is a 64 bit pointer to the files inode data structure in the file descriptor table. (Same as the Master File Table). It contains: permissions, timestamps, number of blocks and locations.

Permissions:
	Typical Access List: -rwxrwxrwx
		'-' means normal file
		number
		name of owner of the file
		group that the owner is associated with.
		1st block - owner
		2nd block - group
		3rd block - everyone else

The 7 file types and their notation in unix:
	-regular files: -
	-directories:    d
	-character device: c
	-block devices:  b
	-links: l
	-sockerts: 
	-named pipes:
